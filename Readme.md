  <h4> Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize pathology. AI refers to the application of modern machine learning techniques to digital tissue images in order to detect, quantify, or characterize specific cell or tissue structures. By automating time‑consuming diagnostic tasks, AI can greatly reduce the workload and help to remedy the serious shortage of pathologists. At the same time, AI can make analyses more sensitive and reproducible and it can capture novel biomarkers from tissue morphology for precision medicine. So, we created a  Machine Learning model for Customer Segmentation Analysis of E-Commerce Industry.

  pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

## :book: Data Preprocessing

Data pre-processing is an important step for the creation of a machine learning
model. Initially, data may not be clean or in the required format for the model which
can cause misleading outcomes. In pre-processing of data, we transform data into our
required format. It is used to deal with noises, duplicates, and missing values of the
dataset. Data pre-processing has the activities like importing datasets, splitting
datasets, attribute scaling, etc. Preprocessing of data is required for improving the
accuracy of the model.
